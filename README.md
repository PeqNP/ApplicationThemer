# ApplicationTheme

Use protocol to apply themes to UI elements.

## TODO
- Inject themer into test view controller and real view controller
- Figure out how to determine if the right `apply` method was called
- Rename `ApplicationThemer` to simply `UITheme`
- Create `UITheme` which takes a generic. This allows a module to define it's own type of themes which an application can implement.
