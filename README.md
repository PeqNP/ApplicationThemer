# ApplicationTheme

Use protocol to apply themes to UI elements.

## Why?

I have a very complex, multi-module, application which requires a separation of "themes" per module. This pattern provides me with a way to define the tyeps of styles that can be applied for a given module (or application) and then apply those styles to elements in the app or module layer.

## Example

This example shows how you can apply styles to `IBOutlet` properties at the time they are created.

```swift

```
